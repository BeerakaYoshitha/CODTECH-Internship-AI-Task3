 # PROJECT: TEXT CLASSIFICATION (NLP PROBLEM)
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Overview of project:

- This project demonstrates a basic text classification technique using a keyword-based approach. It aims to classify text data into predefined categories without relying on advanced machine learning tools. This approach serves as a practical introduction to text classification and keyword analysis.

Objectives:

- Educational Demonstration: Provide a simple example of text classification for learning purposes.

- Keyword-Based Approach: Implement a straightforward method to categorize text based on keyword frequencies.

- Hands-On Experience: Allow users to see how text data can be processed and classified manually.

Key Features:

- Keyword Matching: Classify text by matching keywords to predefined categories.

- Manual Data Processing: Tokenizes and processes text without advanced libraries.

- Basic Accuracy Evaluation: Measures the effectiveness of the classification on a sample dataset.

How It Works:

- Data Preparation: Create a dataset of text reviews labeled with categories like "Action," "Comedy," and "Drama."

- Keyword Mapping: Build a map of keyword frequencies for each category based on the training data.

- Text Classification: Predict the category of new text by comparing keyword frequencies with the map.

- Performance Evaluation: Calculate the accuracy of the classifier by comparing predictions with actual labels.

Technologies Used:

- Python: Programming language used for implementing the classification logic.

- Standard Libraries: Utilizes Pythonâ€™s built-in libraries for text processing and classification.
